# scEVOLVE
# Introduction
Here we develop a new yet practical annotation tool that aims to incrementally learn new cell type knowledge from the data stream.
# Requirement
The version of Python environment and packages we used can be summarized as follows,

python environment >=3.6

torch >=1.10.2

scanpy 1.4.4

scikit-learn 0.20.4

scipy 1.1.0

jgraph 0.2.1

tqdm 4.64.1

...

Please build the corresponding operation environment before running our codes.
# Quickstart
We provide some explanatory descriptions for the codes, please see the specific code files. We supply several kinds of training codes for various baselines and benchmarks. If you want to use the learning strategies in the intra-data setting, you can focus on the "single" series.
